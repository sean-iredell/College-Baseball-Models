Models using proprietary Trackman data

This model was created using data from about 600,000 rows collected from 2,000 games during the 2024 season. It achieved 99% accuracy in predicting strikeout trends across the entire dataset. While it's not as accurate when predicting individual pitchers and teams, it still provided relevant estimates for roughly half of the regional games played.

The model was trained only on data up to May 10th, excluding any postseason data to avoid contaminating the test set. I will continue to upload results from other regional games.

The model's accuracy is likely to improve as the remaining teams are closer in skill level and typically have more available Trackman data compared to smaller schools in regional games.
